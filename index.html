				We are a large, long-standing guild composed of many long-time friends and players. We have a large raiding community filled with people who have raided for multiple expansions and at all difficulty levels. We have run two raid teams since Mists of Pandaria: one that pushes Mythic content and another that aims to clear Heroic. The two teams work together often both inside and outside of raid. For example, Mythic team members often join in on Heroic team runs with their mains and alts, and top performing Heroic team members act as subs for the Mythic team. We run Mythic+ of all levels up to and above 15, all Legion raids, and are generally just a very active and social guild.

   				We are just a group of people who like to play WoW and have fun doing so. We donâ€™t want to make the game feel like a job or an endless grind, despite what some Legion systems tend to lean to. Our Discord server is constantly active in both text and voice channels. You can count on there being some sort of raid happening nearly every night of the week. If you are looking for a stable guild to enjoy the PvE side of the game at all skill levels, then we are your guild
